# Grading-System
The Grading System allows users to input their score and instantly see the grade. Based on predefined ranges, scores 90+ get an A, 80-89 get a B, 70-79 get a C, 60-69 get a D, and below 60 gets an F. This simple tool gives quick feedback, making it easy to assess performance in a clear, user-friendly way.
